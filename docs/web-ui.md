# Web UI

## Overview

React + Vite + TailwindCSS frontend served by FastAPI as static files. Communicates via WebSocket for real-time streaming and REST API for CRUD operations.

```

The sidebar is collapsible (toggle in header, persists via localStorage). The side panel opens on the right when any sub-agent runs (Plan, Explore, general-purpose). Multiple sub-agents get their own tabs. Panel is resizable via drag handle (width persists in localStorage). Toggle with `Cmd/Ctrl + \`.

## Features

### Session Management
- **Sidebar** — Collapsible sidebar with sessions split into Conversations (grouped by date) and System (cron/hook, collapsed). Toggle via header button; state persists in localStorage.
- **Auto-naming** — New sessions get AI-generated titles via Haiku (e.g. "Italy Summer Vacation Planning" instead of the first message text)
- **Resumable sessions** — Sessions persist across server restarts via SDK `--resume` flag; full conversation context is restored
- **Stop button** — Red stop button replaces send during streaming; cancels agent task, saves partial response

### Agent Status
- **Live indicator** — Header shows current agent state: "Thinking...", "Writing...", "Using Read...", etc.
- **Per-session** — Sidebar shows spinner on the active session when agent is working

### Tool Call Rendering
Tool calls are collapsed by default with specialized renderers:
- **Edit** — Unified diff with red/green highlighting
- **Bash** — Terminal-styled with `$` prompt and output
- **Read/Write** — File path prominent, line count, collapsible content
- **Memory** (recall/memorize/history) — Parsed memory items with colored type badges (event, profile, knowledge, behavior)
- **Tasks** (create/list/update/done) — Task cards with status badges
- **Skills** (skill_list/get/create/update/read_reference/run_script) — Purple-themed cards. Load Skill shows skill name badge + line count; Create Skill shows name, description, and content preview; List Skills parses into individual skill cards; Update shows content diff preview.
- **Subagents** (Task tool) — Compact card in main chat with icon, type, description, summary line, and "View →" button. Full tool calls and results are routed to the side panel instead of cluttering the main chat. Expand chevron still available as inline fallback.
- **AskUserQuestion** — Interactive question card with clickable options (radio for single-select, checkboxes for multi-select). Multiple questions grouped in one card with a shared Submit button. Markdown previews on hover. When the agent is paused mid-turn (via `can_use_tool`), answers are sent through the interaction protocol (`answer_interaction` WebSocket message), injecting them into the SDK's `answers` field so the agent continues seamlessly. Falls back to a regular chat message for historical/non-interactive renders.
- **ExitPlanMode / EnterPlanMode** — Approval card with Allow/Decline buttons. Agent pauses mid-turn until the user responds. Plan panel auto-closes on approval.

### Modified Files Panel
GitHub PR-style diff viewer for files modified during a session. Accessible via the `[📁 N]` badge button in the chat header (appears when files have been modified).

- **File list view** — Cards for each modified file showing status badge (M/+/D), filename, parent directory, and `+N -M` diff stats. Click to drill into the diff.
- **Diff detail view** — Unified diff with dual line-number gutters, colored backgrounds (green additions, red deletions), hunk headers (`@@`), and collapsed context between hunks. Powered by `difflib.unified_diff` on the backend — works without git.
- **Snapshot-based** — Original file content is captured via `PreToolUse` hook before the first modification in each session. Only first touch is stored (`INSERT OR IGNORE`). Subsequent edits accumulate in the diff.
- **Reload resilient** — Snapshots persist in SQLite (`session_file_snapshots` table). On page reload/session switch, `fetchModifiedFiles` re-fetches from the REST API.
- **Real-time badge** — `file_changed` WebSocket events increment the header badge count as the agent works.
- **Persistent tab** — The files tab in the side panel does not auto-close (unlike sub-agent tabs).

### Side Panel
Generic tabbed panel that replaces the old plan-only preview panel. Auto-opens when any sub-agent runs:

- **Tabbed interface** — Each sub-agent gets its own tab (Plan, Explore, general-purpose). Tab bar appears when multiple tabs exist. Tabs show icon, label, elapsed time (running) or duration (complete).
- **Live activity feed** — Sub-agent's internal tool calls (Read, Grep, Bash, etc.) and thinking blocks are rendered in the panel using the **same components as the main chat** (ToolCallBlock, ThinkingBlock, etc.), not the main message stream. Routing uses `parent_tool_use_id` from the SDK to correctly attribute events to the right panel, even for parallel sub-agents.
- **Final result** — When the sub-agent completes, its markdown result appears below the activity feed, separated by a divider.
- **Plan actions** — Plan tabs get Approve/Decline buttons in the footer. When `ExitPlanMode` fires, both buttons appear. Approve resolves the interaction; Decline denies so the agent can revise.
- **Plan live updates** — Backend broadcasts `plan_update` WS events when Write/Edit targets `.claude/plans/` files, updating the panel content in real-time.
- **Auto-close** — Non-plan tabs (Explore, general-purpose) auto-close 5 seconds after completion. Plan tabs only close on explicit approve/decline.
- **Resizable** — Drag the left edge to resize (20%–65%). Width persists in localStorage.
- **Keyboard shortcut** — `Cmd/Ctrl + \` toggles panel visibility.
- **Animated** — Panel slides in/out with a 200ms width transition matching the sidebar animation.
- **Selection comments** — Select text in plan content to add/remove/improve/ask/note, same as in chat messages.

### Diagnostics Panel
System status dashboard (`/diagnostics`) with:
- **System** — Hostname, platform, memory (RSS), disk usage
- **Sources** — Per-source sync status: cursor, last run, records fetched/processed, errors
- **Tasks / FTS Index** — Active/done counts, FTS indexed vs total, in-sync status indicator (green ✓ / red ✗)
- **Recent Cron Logs** — Job ID, status, timestamps, errors

### Reload Resilience
- Server buffers streaming events per session
- On reconnect/tab switch, buffered events are replayed to reconstruct streaming state
- REST `/api/sessions/{id}/status` fallback for session running state
- **Ordered blocks** — Assistant messages store an ordered `blocks` JSON column in the DB, preserving the exact interleaving of thinking/text/tool_call blocks from streaming. On page reload, `hydrateMessage` uses this column directly instead of reconstructing from separate fields. Pre-migration messages fall back to the old thinking→tools→text ordering.

## Development

```bash
cd web

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Dev server (proxies to backend on :8900)
npm run dev

# Production build
npx vite build
```

The dev server proxies `/api` and `/ws` to `localhost:8900`.

## Build & Deploy

```bash
# Build production bundle
cd web && npx vite build

# Output goes to web/dist/
# FastAPI serves this directory automatically
```

## State Management

Uses Zustand for lightweight state management:
- `authStore` — Login/logout, token management
- `chatStore` — Sessions, messages, streaming state, agent status, side panel state (tabs, visibility, width), pending interactions (mid-turn user input), sidebar collapsed state, text selection quotes, modified files tracking. WebSocket message handling is dispatched to domain-specific handler modules under `handlers/`, with stateless helpers under `helpers/`.
- `taskStore` — Task list, search, filters, detail view with content editing
- `skillsStore` — Skills list with usage stats, detail view with SKILL.md editor, create/update/delete/toggle, filesystem sync
