## Modes

Nerve supports two modes, selected during `nerve init`:

**Personal** — a full-featured assistant for one human. Ships with sync sources (Telegram, Gmail, GitHub), life-oriented memory categories, identity files (`IDENTITY.md`, `USER.md`), and the inbox-processor cron. The agent develops personality over time.

**Worker** — a task-focused autonomous agent. Ships with operational memory categories, a `TASK.md` mission brief, no sync sources, and a self-configuring onboarding flow. Operates in a plan-approve-execute loop.

Mode affects which workspace templates are generated, which cron jobs are enabled, and which memory categories are seeded — but the underlying engine is identical. Both modes run the same agent, tools, and infrastructure.

## Deployment

Two deployment options:

**Server (bare metal)** — Nerve runs directly as a Python process. Uses `nerve start` for daemon management, `nerve stop` / `nerve restart` for lifecycle.

**Docker** — `nerve init` generates `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, and `docker-entrypoint.sh`. The code is bind-mounted (editable), while databases and workspace are in named volumes. CLI commands (`nerve start`, `nerve logs`, etc.) automatically proxy to `docker compose` when `deployment: docker` is set in config. Credentials are resolved from the host (macOS Keychain, env vars, credential files) and injected into the container — `~/.claude` is NOT mounted.

## Components

### Gateway (`nerve/gateway/`)
FastAPI application serving:
- REST API for sessions, tasks, memory files, diagnostics
- WebSocket endpoint for real-time chat streaming
- Static file serving for the built React web UI
- JWT authentication

### Agent Engine (`nerve/agent/`)
Claude Agent SDK wrapper providing:
- Agent configuration (model, tools, system prompt)
- Agentic loop execution (tool calls → results → continuation)
- **Interactive tool handler** — `can_use_tool` callback replaces `bypassPermissions`; pauses the agent mid-turn for tools that need user input (`AskUserQuestion`, `ExitPlanMode`, `EnterPlanMode`), auto-approves everything else. Answers routed via WebSocket `answer_interaction` messages. See `interactive.py`.
- **File snapshot hooks** — `PreToolUse` hook on `Edit|Write|NotebookEdit` captures original file content to `session_file_snapshots` table before the tool executes. Enables session-scoped unified diffs without git. See `engine.py::_build_snapshot_hooks()`.
- **Diff computation** — `gateway/diff.py` computes structured unified diffs (hunks with line numbers) using `difflib.unified_diff` from stored snapshots vs current file on disk.
- Streaming bridge to broadcast events to all interfaces (bounded buffers, max 10k events)
- **Session lifecycle management** — explicit states (created → active → idle → stopped → archived → error) with transitions logged to `session_events` table
- **Session resume** via SDK `--resume` flag (survives server restarts; `sdk_session_id` stored as a first-class DB column)
- **Session forking** — branch conversations via SDK `fork_session=True`, exposed through REST API and WebSocket
- **Session stop** — uses SDK `client.interrupt()` for clean stop, falls back to `task.cancel()`
- **Persistent channel mappings** — channel-to-session mapping stored in `channel_sessions` table (survives restarts)
- **Orphan recovery** — on startup, sessions marked `active` in DB but with no live client are transitioned to `idle` (resumable) or `stopped`
- **Automatic cleanup** — periodic task (every 6h) archives stale sessions (default 30 days) and enforces max session count (default 500)
- **Per-run cron sessions** — each cron run gets a unique session ID (`cron:{job_id}:{timestamp}`) to prevent unbounded message accumulation
- AI-generated session titles via lightweight Haiku API call
- Custom MCP tools (tasks, memory recall, conversation history, sync status, skills CRUD, notifications)
- API calls routed through configurable base URL (direct Anthropic API or local CLIProxyAPI proxy)

### Channels (`nerve/channels/`)
Abstract communication layer with three components:
- **BaseChannel** — abstract interface with capability declarations (`ChannelCapability` flags: `SEND_TEXT`, `STREAMING`, `MARKDOWN`, `INTERACTIVE`, `TYPING_INDICATOR`) and streaming protocol (`send_placeholder`, `edit_message`). Channels declare capabilities; the router checks them before calling optional methods.
- **ChannelRouter** — centralized session resolution, streaming adapter lifecycle, interactive tool routing, and cron output delivery. Replaces per-channel session management.
- **StreamAdapter** — translates `StreamBroadcaster` events into channel-appropriate output (edit-in-place for Telegram, accumulated send for simple channels). Created per inbound message.

Implementations:
- **Telegram** — python-telegram-bot v21+ with partial message streaming (edit-in-place, 1.5s rate limit), inline keyboard buttons for notification questions, `/reply` command for free-text answers
- **Web** — Passive channel using gateway WebSocket

Adding a new channel (Discord, WhatsApp, etc.) requires implementing ~5 methods and zero session/routing logic.

### Notifications (`nerve/notifications/`)
Async notification system for agent→user communication:
- **`notify` tool** — fire-and-forget notifications (status updates, alerts, reminders)
- **`ask_user` tool** — questions with predefined options (rendered as buttons) + free-text input. Supports blocking mode (`wait=true`) and async mode (answer injected as session message)
- **NotificationService** — centralized fanout to configurable channels (web + Telegram by default), answer routing, periodic expiry
- **Multi-channel delivery** — web UI via `__global__` WebSocket broadcast channel, Telegram via direct bot API with inline keyboard buttons for questions
- **Answer routing** — answers from any channel (web UI, Telegram inline button, `/reply` command) are persisted and either unblock a waiting tool or injected as a user message into the originating session
- **Web UI** — `/notifications` page with status/type filters, inline answer buttons, dismiss, dismiss-all; real-time toast overlay for new notifications; NavRail badge for pending count

### Cron Service (`nerve/cron/`)
APScheduler-based job scheduler:
- Crontab and interval triggers
- Isolated sessions per job
- Persistent logging

### Sources (`nerve/sources/`)
Cursor-based data ingestion with agent processing:
- Pull-based source adapters (Telegram/Telethon, Gmail/gog CLI, GitHub/gh CLI)
- Records routed through processors: `agent` (LLM review), `memorize` (direct memU), `notify` (channel forward)
- Opaque cursor per source in SQLite — advances only after successful processing
- Auto-registered as APScheduler jobs alongside cron jobs
- See [sources.md](sources.md) for details

### Memory (`nerve/memory/`)
Dual-layer memory:
- **File-based** — MEMORY.md, identity files (curated source of truth, loaded into system prompt)
- **memU** — Semantic index over conversations and files (SQLite-persisted at `~/.nerve/memu.sqlite`)
- **Knowledge quality filtering** — Custom extraction prompt + post-extraction Haiku filter + semantic deduplication prevent generic CS/DevOps facts from polluting memory
- **Session rotation** — Main session rotates daily; conversations are indexed into memU on close
- **Session resume** — SDK session IDs stored as dedicated DB columns; sessions resume with full context via `--resume` flag
- **Session forking** — Fork conversations from any point; new session branches via SDK `fork_session=True`
- **Crash recovery** — On startup, sessions marked `active` in DB with no live client are recovered: those with `sdk_session_id` become `idle` (resumable), others become `stopped`

### Skills (`nerve/skills/`)
Filesystem-based skill system (Claude SDK compatible):
- Skills stored as `workspace/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter
- Optional `references/`, `scripts/`, `assets/` subdirectories
- SQLite index for metadata + usage statistics (`skills`, `skill_usage` tables)
- Progressive disclosure: name+description in system prompt, full content loaded on demand via `skill_get` tool
- Agent can create/update skills dynamically via `skill_create`/`skill_update` MCP tools
- Automated extraction: `skill-extractor` cron identifies repeated workflows and proposes new skills via task+plan system
- Automated revision: `skill-reviser` cron reviews existing skills for accuracy, completeness, and quality
- Plan approval handler creates/updates skills directly when approving skill-extractor/skill-reviser proposals

### House of Agents (`nerve/houseofagents/`)
Optional multi-agent execution runtime using [houseofagents](https://github.com/ClickHouse/houseofagents):
- Orchestrates Claude, OpenAI, and Gemini agents in relay, swarm, or pipeline (DAG) modes
- Exposed as a **session-scoped MCP tool** (`hoa_execute`) — the agent calls it, progress streams to UI in real-time via `StreamBroadcaster`, then the agent continues with verification and cleanup
- Binary lifecycle: auto-download from GitHub releases, `cargo install` fallback for aarch64
- Pipeline configs stored as TOML files in `~/.nerve/houseofagents/pipelines/`
- Plan approval UI supports runtime selection: default (single session) or multi-agent
- Disabled by default; enable via `houseofagents.enabled: true` in config
- Configured via `houseofagents.*` settings in config

### Proxy (`nerve/proxy/`)
Optional local HTTP proxy that routes Anthropic API calls through Claude Code's OAuth authentication:
- Eliminates the need for a direct Anthropic API key
- Uses [CLIProxyAPI](https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI) binary (auto-downloaded on first start)
- OAuth tokens refreshed automatically
- Configured via `proxy.*` settings in config — see [config.md](config.md#proxy-cliproxyapi)

### Tasks (`nerve/tasks/`)
Markdown + SQLite task system:
- Task files in `workspace/memory/tasks/`
- SQLite index for queries
- Escalation reminders (soft → medium → urgent)

## Data Flow

### User Message (Telegram)
1. User sends message via Telegram
2. `TelegramChannel` receives it, resolves active session
3. `AgentEngine.run()` is called with the message
4. System prompt is built (SOUL.md + IDENTITY.md + memories)
5. Claude Agent SDK processes the message with tools
6. Streaming events broadcast to Telegram (edit-in-place) and any WebSocket clients
7. Final response stored in SQLite

### User Message (Web UI)
1. User sends message via WebSocket
2. Gateway's WebSocket handler receives it
3. `AgentEngine.run()` called in background task
4. Streaming events sent back via WebSocket
5. Client renders tokens in real-time

### Cron Job
1. APScheduler triggers at schedule
2. Isolated per-run session created (`cron:{job_id}:{timestamp}`)
3. Agent runs with job prompt and cron model
4. Agent uses `notify`/`ask_user` tools to communicate with user
5. Run logged in `cron_logs` table

## Database

### Package Structure

The database layer lives in `nerve/db/` as a Python package with domain-specific modules:

```
nerve/db/
├── __init__.py        # Re-exports Database, init_db, close_db, SCHEMA_VERSION
├── base.py            # Database class (connection, _atomic, FTS check)
├── migrations/        # File-based migration system
│   ├── runner.py      # Discovers and applies vNNN_*.py files in order
│   ├── v001_initial.py
│   ├── ...
│   └── v016_mcp_servers.py
├── sessions.py        # SessionStore mixin
├── messages.py        # MessageStore mixin
├── tasks.py           # TaskStore mixin
├── plans.py           # PlanStore mixin
├── notifications.py   # NotificationStore mixin
├── sources.py         # SourceStore mixin (inbox, sync cursors, consumer cursors)
├── cron.py            # CronStore mixin
├── skills.py          # SkillStore mixin
├── mcp.py             # McpStore mixin
└── audit.py           # AuditStore mixin
```

The `Database` class in `base.py` inherits all domain mixins, preserving a single `Database` interface. All existing imports (`from nerve.db import Database`) work unchanged via `__init__.py` re-exports.

### Migrations

Migrations are individual Python files in `nerve/db/migrations/` named `vNNN_description.py`. Each exports an `async def up(db)` function. The runner discovers them by scanning the directory, applies pending ones in version order, and wraps each in a transaction. `SCHEMA_VERSION` is derived dynamically from the highest migration file number.

To add a new migration: create `nerve/db/migrations/v017_your_feature.py` with an `up()` function.

### Schema

SQLite with WAL mode (schema version 16):
- `sessions` — Session metadata with lifecycle columns (`status`, `sdk_session_id`, `connected_at`, `parent_session_id`, `forked_from_message`, `last_activity_at`, `archived_at`, `message_count`, `total_cost_usd`)
- `messages` — Conversation messages with tool call data and ordered `blocks` JSON column (preserves interleaving of text/thinking/tool_call blocks across page reloads)
- `session_events` — Append-only lifecycle audit log (created, started, idle, stopped, archived, error)
- `channel_sessions` — Persistent channel-to-session mapping (survives restarts)
- `session_file_snapshots` — Pre-modification file content captured via `PreToolUse` hook for session-scoped diff computation. Keyed by `(session_id, file_path)`, first-touch only. Cleaned up on session delete.
- `tasks` — Task index (mirrors markdown files)
- `tasks_fts` — FTS5 full-text search index for tasks
- `sync_cursors` — Opaque cursor positions per source
- `source_run_log` — Per-source run diagnostics (records fetched/processed, errors)
- `source_messages` — Source inbox with TTL-based expiry
- `consumer_cursors` — Kafka-like consumer positions per source
- `cron_logs` — Job execution history (includes source runs as `source:<name>`)
- `memu_audit_log` — memU operation audit trail
- `plans` — Plans proposed by planner agent for async human review
- `skills` — Skill registry (id, name, description, version, enabled, metadata)
- `skill_usage` — Skill invocation tracking (skill_id, session_id, invoked_by, duration, success/error)
- `notifications` — Async notifications and questions (id, session_id, type, title, body, priority, status, options, answer, delivery tracking, expiry)
- `mcp_servers` — MCP server registry (config is source of truth, DB tracks metadata)
- `mcp_tool_usage` — MCP tool invocation tracking

memU SQLite (`~/.nerve/memu.sqlite`):
- `memu_resources` — Indexed source files/conversations
- `memu_memory_items` — Extracted facts with embeddings
- `memu_memory_categories` — Topic categories with rolling summaries
- `memu_category_items` — Category-item links

## Startup Sequence

1. Load config (`config.yaml` + `config.local.yaml` deep merge)
2. Run database migrations (file-based migration system in `nerve/db/migrations/`)
3. Initialize memory system (memU SQLite, load categories)
4. Start CLIProxyAPI proxy if enabled (download binary if missing, authenticate, start subprocess)
5. Recover orphan sessions (active in DB but no live client → idle or stopped)
6. Start cron service (load system.yaml + jobs.yaml, register source runners, catch up missed jobs)
7. Start gateway (FastAPI + uvicorn, WebSocket, static files)
8. Start Telegram bot if configured
9. **Worker onboarding** — if worker mode and TASK.md lacks `## Mission`, run the setup agent session

## Security

- JWT authentication for all API/WebSocket access
- bcrypt password hashing
- Path traversal prevention on file operations
- Self-signed HTTPS (mkcert)
- Single-user system — no multi-tenancy
